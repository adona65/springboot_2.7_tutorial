<!-- 
Static resources, including HTML, JavaScript and CSS, can be served from Spring Boot application by dropping them into the right place 
in the source code. By default, Spring Boot serves static content from resources in the classpath at "/stati"c (or "/public"). 
The "index.html" resource is special because, if it exists, it is used as a "welcome page", which means it is served up as the root 
resource (that is, at "http://localhost:8080/").
